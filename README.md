In this project I've used a lot of what we have learnt from the previous two assingments and have tried some things that were new to me.

What's been new for me with this project is mostly that I have focused a lot more on the looks of the application, compared to before. 

Among the new things I've tried are:
- Working with a **API** that's been **new** to me
- **Editing the header bar more**, like adding colors or removing the header bar completely
- Using **Dimensions** to make the size work on all screen sizes. I did not manage to do it on all screens tho. 
- Using **ImageBackground** to have an image as an background instead of just background color
- Using **numColumns** to be able to present 3 items on the same row instead of just 1
